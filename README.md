				<li>ROI is an important factor for business</li>
				<li>ROI could be determined as
					<ul>
						<li>The cost of individual intervention</li>
						<li>The cost and non cost benefits on helping a patient not needing to readmit again in less than 30 days</li>
                        <li>The success rate of the intervention program</li>
                        <li>A non financial ROI such as improving a business image</li>

                        </li>

                                <li>Could enable business use a high probability threshold</li>
                                <li>This means they are helping less patients</li>
                                <li>But if an insurance company can take steps and help even small number of patients, it could still be huge cost saving for them.

                                <li>The cost of intervention and its success rate will be deciding factors</li>
                                <li>A threshold and the data pattern can be decided which would maximize the business financial and non financial ROI</li>
                                <li> This is a limited data we used for modeling, an good ROI when using models with limited data could encourage business invest more in gathering more data in pursuit of better ROI.</li>
